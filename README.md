I am too lazy to write this, but 

	when unzipped, add this folder to the path in 'Environment Variables'

	thats about installation you need to do assuming you have powershell.

	Once, installed just run '.\YTvideos'.
	If this didn't work, try   mpv "yt_URL" to see if the mpv environment
is working as intended and the Environment Variables are set properly.


I am new to all this, I am merely doing this for my entertainment.
Have fun!
