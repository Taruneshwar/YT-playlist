I am too lazy to write this, but 

when cloned, intall the mpv and yt-dlp and make sure they are in the same folder (move the yt-dlp.exe to the same folder as mpv.exe)
 add this folder to the path in 'Environment Variables'

thats about installation you need to do assuming you have powershell.

Once, installed just run 

		.\YTvideos.ps1
If this didn't work, try   

 		mpv "yt_URL"
to see if the mpv environment is working as intended and the Environment Variables are set properly.


I am new to all this, I am merely doing this for my entertainment.
Have fun!
